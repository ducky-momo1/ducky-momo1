## Hello! üëã

I'm Momoka, a Computer Science student at the City College of New York's Grove School of Engineering. I'm looking to apply my knowledge of software in a number of areas, including game development, robotics, and cybersecurity! I'm currently exploring the option of machine learning as a Fellow in Break Through Tech's AI Program, where I will soon be creating models to solve real world problems.

You'll sometimes see me getting involved with FIRST, a global nonprofit robotics organization, whether it's through volunteering at competitions, mentoring my former high school's FIRST Tech Challenge team, or watching FIRST Robotics Competition matches. I also like to spend my time playing video games or watching videos about games!
