## Hello! 🦕

I'm Momoka, a Computer Science student at the City College of New York's Grove School of Engineering. I'm looking to apply my knowledge of software in a number of areas, including game development, robotics, and cybersecurity! I'm currently exploring machine learning as a Fellow in Break Through Tech's AI Program, where I create predictive models that aim to solve real-world problems.

## Featured Project: [Power Outage Prediction Model](https://github.com/Adewale-1/Abt_Global_1B) for Abt Global ⚡️
My team of 5 Break Through Tech AI/ML Fellows and I have been designing, developing, training, and evaluating machine learning models for research/technical assistance firm Abt Global to predict electrical power outages using weather data.

Using Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn, we've performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning techniques to train numerous regression models that all have an accuracy of over 90%. We're currently working on creating a model for each of our 12 strategically selected counties to generate even more accurate results that are tailored to the weather of that specific region.
